Vim-present
===========

(Yet another) tool for giving presentations from vim.


Usage
-----

Place your slides in slides, with names prefixed with numbers. Feel free
to use file extensions depending on slide, e.g. `.rst` for text, and `.py`
for code to get syntax highlighting.

Launch with `$ ./start`

Note
----

You'll probably want to bump the font size of your terminal. Remember to do
this when designing the slides!
